# Senior Project
For my Senior Project, I am rebuilding my WDD 130 final project. I will be writing the backend (it was originally frontend only), re-writing the frontend, adding a course or two, writing a few tutorials, and hopefully incorporating a coding playground (for HTML/JS/CSS, Python, and maybe Processing.js).

**Hours worked:** ~111
